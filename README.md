These are slides from a talk I did at [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) for the 2014 fellows to introduce maps, how they work, and the landscape of GIS in government. There is also a section about web maps and how they work, which is very similar (i.e. the same) as the slides in my [Hell Yes, Leaflet!](http://lyzidiamond.com/leaflet) presentation.

This is a work in progress. I might change some stuff. I probably should, actually. And there's lots of other things that could be included. And stuff.
